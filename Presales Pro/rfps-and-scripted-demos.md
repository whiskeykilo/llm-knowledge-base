# Cheat Sheet — *RFPs and Scripted Demos* (Great Demo!)

## Overview  

- RFPs and scripted demos are **high-effort, high-risk engagements**
- Many RFPs come from **Late Majority prospects** and often lead to **No Decision** outcomes
- Winning requires **strategic qualification**, **biasing the process**, and **demo excellence**:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## RFP Participation Strategy

### 1. **Decide Rationally — Not Emotionally**  

- Ask key questions before committing:  
  - Can you access the prospect for discovery?  
  - Is the RFP biased toward a competitor?  
  - What is the prospect’s track record of actual purchase?  
  - Is the opportunity worth the resource investment?  
- Apply a **portfolio approach**: say *yes* only to winnable RFPs. Hope is not a strategy

### 2. **Engage the Consultant**  

- Treat consultants as customers — **help them win** too
- Provide slightly biased RFP templates regularly to shape future RFPs
- Use consultants as conduits for communication and influence

### 3. **Be First (or Last)**  

- First RFP responses and demos set **anchors**
- First creates reference points for all comparisons
- Last benefits from **primacy/recency effect** and “saved the best for last” positioning

### 4. **Leverage the Anchoring Effect**  

- Deliver early to bias perception
- Volunteer to demo first to influence evaluation criteria
- If not first, aim to demo last

### 5. **Add Rows**  

- Insert additional capabilities into the RFP that play to your strengths
- Structure biased statements with four parts:  
  1. Similar customer example  
  2. Capability description  
  3. Tangible value gains  
  4. Recommendation to include  
- Works because prospects often don’t know what they’re missing

### 6. **Ask Smart Questions**  

- If discovery is allowed, use it to reshape the RFP
- Biased questions can insert capabilities indirectly
- Being first with insightful questions positions you as a thought leader

### 7. **Pull Back When Needed**  

- If stacked against you, **withdraw strategically**
- Can trigger concessions (e.g., discovery access) or reveal your real position (Column Fodder)
- If they don’t care when you pull back, you were never going to win

## Scripted Demo Best Practices

### Core Demo Principles  

1. **Fewest Clicks** — efficiency matters
2. **Organize in Chunks** — digestible components
3. **Inverted Pyramid** — start with key results first
4. **Use Illustrations** — one picture = 1000 clicks
5. **Summarize Often** — adults learn by repetition

Ignoring these gives competitors a major advantage.

## Tactics to Win Scripted Demos

### Rearrange the Order  

- Align demo flow with **your optimal story**, not just their list
- Use capability checklists to map between their order and yours
- If blocked, consider pulling back

### Menu Approach  

- Segment demos by persona or department
- Lets each audience follow a relevant path
- Mirrors restaurant-style “appetizer–entrée–dessert” menus to structure flow

### Subvert the Introduction  

- **Kill the corporate overview**. It wastes time
- Replace with Situation Slides + Illustrations focused on the prospect
- Or give the time back and skip it entirely

### Use a Checklist  

- Show progress clearly
- Gain verbal confirmation on each item’s completion
- Include checklist summary in follow-ups as proof

### Add Rows During Demos  

- Introduce missing capabilities through **biased questions** mid-demo
- Show them only if the prospect agrees
- This biases the evaluation without violating script constraints

### Understand Scoring  

- Know the prospect’s scoring system:  
  - Binary (Yes/No)  
  - Click count  
  - Time elapsed  
  - Scales (1–10)  
- Confirm scoring after each capability to avoid surprises

## Engage, Entertain, Enliven  

Scripted demos are long and boring—**refresh attention every 10 minutes**
Use:  

- Props and visual aids  
- Analogies and storytelling  
- Movement and whiteboards  
- Alternate presenters  
- Audience participation  
- Breaks with odd lengths (e.g., 7 minutes)  
- Frequent summarization

- **Bias the process early** through consultants, anchoring, and rows
- **Structure scripted demos** with Great Demo! principles
- **Control narrative flow** with menu approaches and checklists
- **Refresh attention** and keep the audience engaged throughout
- RFPs and scripted demos are resource-intensive. **Choose wisely** which to pursue
