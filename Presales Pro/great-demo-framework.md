## Step Details

### 1. Situation  

- Job title and industry  
- **CBI** (Critical Business Issue): what they can’t do now  
- **Problem/Reason**: why it’s hard  
- **Specific Capabilities**: what they need  
- **Delta**: value difference (e.g. save 20 days)  
- **Critical Date**: deadline or urgency  

### 2. Illustration  

- Show the **end state** first
- Make it live and relevant
- Reiterate the Delta (business value)

- Audience questions drive the flow

### 5. Manage Questions  

- **Great Questions** → answer immediately
- **Good Questions** → add to “Not Now” list, address later

## Multiple-Solution Demos  

1. Introduction  
2. Present Situation + Illustrations for each solution  
3. For each solution:  
   - Reintroduce & show Illustration  
   - Do It → Summarize  
   - Peel Back Layers → Summarize  
4. Global Summary  
5. Q&A  
6. Final Summary

## Measuring the Delta (Value)  

- **Time** (Cheaper)  
- **People** (Better)  
- **Money** (Faster)  
- **New Capability** (Couldn’t be done before)

End with the **best, most compelling screen** — the Illustration

## Objectives: Two Demo Types  

- **Technical Proof** → Prove identified capabilities from discovery
- **Vision Generation** → Build a vision collaboratively with the customer

## Key Principle  
>
> **“Do the Last Thing First.”**  
Start with the most impactful outcome (Illustration), then justify and explore
