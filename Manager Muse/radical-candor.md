# Cheat Sheet — *Radical Candor* by Kim Scott

- Its aim is to build trust, open communication, and high performance  
- Helps avoid feedback traps and fosters candid culture

---

## Core Concepts

### Care Personally  

- Be human. Share more than the professional self
- Show real concern for people’s lives, aspirations, struggles
- Build relationships as a foundation for influence

### Challenge Directly  

- Offer honest feedback — praise and criticism — clearly, specifically, and promptly
- Avoid sugarcoating and delay
- Embrace conflict as a tool for growth when grounded in care

### Feedback Quadrants  

| Quadrant | Description |
|---|---|
| **Radical Candor** | High care + high challenge. Ideal zone. |
| **Ruinous Empathy** | High care, low challenge. Avoids discomfort at the cost of growth. |
| **Obnoxious Aggression** | Low care, high challenge. Forces results but damages trust. |
| **Manipulative Insincerity** | Low care, low challenge. Political, passive, dishonest. |

## Enhanced Practices & Tactics

### Giving Feedback  

- Use **Situation → Behavior → Impact** framing (for both praise & criticism)
- Preface feedback with your intention: “I hope this helps; I could be wrong”  
- Deliver feedback immediately when possible, even briefly between meetings
- Praise in public; criticism in private (but use discretion — corrections can sometimes happen publicly)
- Avoid phrasing feedback in personal terms. Critique the work, not the person

### Receiving Feedback  

- Solicit feedback often
- Listen without defensiveness
- Ask: “What should I start / stop / keep doing?”  
- Model vulnerability by admitting errors or misperceptions

### Motivation & Growth  

- Understand each person’s ambition path (rock star vs. superstar)
- Hold **career conversations** in three parts: life story, dreams, 18-month plan
- Align roles/projects to what they want to learn or become
- Don’t force “passion” – treat meaning as co-created, not imposed

### Decision Flow & Culture  

- Build a cycle: **Listen → Debate → Decide → Persuade → Execute → Learn**
- Ensure people feel heard and can dissent
- Explain course corrections transparently when decisions change
- Block time for execution—don’t let meetings consume all energy

### 1:1s & Meetings  

- 1:1s are essential. Let the direct report drive agenda
- Ask deep questions: “What wakes you at night?” “How can I help?”  
- Detect signs you’re failing: canceled 1:1s, only good news, no feedback
- Limit meeting load. Create “think time” or “meeting-free” zones

### Emotional Intelligence & Trust  

- Acknowledge and own your moods when appropriate
- Don’t try to suppress others’ emotions—respond with compassion
- Share your own challenges to normalize vulnerability
- Build trust by investing in personal connection (e.g. occasional 1:1 time outside work focus)

## Key Takeaways (Updated)  

- Radical Candor is not about being blunt — it’s about being clear *while caring*
- Feedback is a *gift*, not a stick
- Growth comes from balancing praise + criticism in ways that build trust
- Everyone drifts among quadrants; self awareness and team feedback keep you centered
- Schedule, process, and emotional safety all matter as much as “what you say”
