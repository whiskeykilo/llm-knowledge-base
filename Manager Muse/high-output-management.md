# Cheat Sheet — *High Output Management*

by Andrew Grove

## Overview  

- Grove treats management as a production process
- A manager’s output equals the output of their team plus the output of teams they influence
- The book focuses on leverage, training, decision making, and building systems that scale

## Core Concepts

### Managerial Output & Leverage  

- Maximize impact through high-leverage activities
- Training, motivation, and early-stage planning yield the highest returns
- Eliminate low-leverage work and avoid negative leverage (e.g., indecision)
- Delegate decisions and tasks to the lowest competent level

### Production & Indicators  

- Think like a factory: quality, schedule, cost
- Identify bottlenecks and limiting steps
- Use indicators (metrics) to reveal system health early
- Catch defects at the lowest-value stage to minimize cost and disruption

### Meetings as Work  

- Meetings are core managerial tools, not distractions
- Two types:  
  1. **Process-oriented** (information flow)  
  2. **Mission-oriented** (decision making)  
- Each meeting must have a clear objective, owner, and actionable output

### Decision Making  

- Define decision roles: who decides, who is consulted, who can veto, who is informed
- Clarity beats consensus; avoid peer-group syndrome
- Once decisions are made, all parties must commit
- Escalate decisions only when necessary

### Planning & Objectives  

- Forecast demand → assess current state → reconcile the gap
- Use OKRs/MBO for structured goal setting and measurement
- Resource allocation and conflict resolution are central planning tasks
- Treat your calendar as a production plan

### Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)  

- Match management style to an individual’s competence and commitment
- High TRM = more delegation; low TRM = more direction
- Adjust over time as maturity changes
- Avoid micromanagement or blind delegation

### Training & Motivation  

- Underperformance = lack of ability or lack of motivation
- Diagnose the root cause before acting
- Training is a core managerial responsibility
- Motivation comes from environment, challenge, and recognition

### Performance Reviews & Talent  

- Reviews should improve performance, not just evaluate
- Feedback must be frank, specific, and task-focused
- Promotions set cultural tone; choose carefully
- Hiring, developing, and reallocating talent drives long-term output

### Organizational Control Modes  

- Three levers:  
  1. Free market forces  
  2. Contracts/formal rules  
  3. Culture/shared values  
- Most organizations use a hybrid mix
- Choose control modes based on context and maturity
